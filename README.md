# Chapter-3-Projects

This is just a collection of simple projects I've created to apply the concepts I've learned from Chapter 3 of the Python Documentation: https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/introduction.html

Please note that all of the software I create for personal use and enjoyment will always be free of charge and open-source. Feel free to use, modify, and distribute any of these scripts to your heart's content.
